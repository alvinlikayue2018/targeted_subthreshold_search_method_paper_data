# Data release for ``Targeted Sub-threshold Search for Strongly-lensed Gravitational-wave Events"
This git repository serves to provide search results for the paper ````Targeted Sub-threshold Search for Strongly-lensed Gravitational-wave Events".

In this git repository you will find:
* Full candidate list of targeted-subthreshold search for LIGO-VIRGO observing runs O1/O2.
* Reduced template bank plot for O1/O2 gravitational wave events.
* Skymaps of all found possible lensed candidates for each targeted events.

## Full candidate list
Note that candidates are ranked in ascending order of FAR.
